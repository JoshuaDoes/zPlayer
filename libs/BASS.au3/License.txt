BASS.DLL has a different license, which you must adhere to.  

The licensing prices was correct at time of release.  This may change without notice.  
Please see un4seen's website for more. 
	http://un4seen.com/bass.html#license

BASS is free for non-commercial use. If you are a non-commercial entity (eg. an individual) 
and you are not charging for your product, and the product has no other commercial purpose,
then you can use BASS in it for free. Otherwise, you will require one of the following 
licences.

Shareware licence: €100
The "shareware" licence allows the usage of BASS in an unlimited number of your shareware 
products, which must sell for no more than 40 Euros each. If you're an individual (not a 
corporation) making and selling your own software (and its price is within the limit), this 
is the licence for you.

Single Commercial licence: €950
The "single commercial" licence allows the usage of BASS in a single commercial product.

Unlimited Commercial licence: €2450
The "unlimited commercial" licence allows the usage of BASS in an unlimited number of 
your commercial products. This licence applies to a single site/location.

In all cases there are no royalties to pay and you can use future BASS updates without 
further cost. Reselling/sublicensing is not permitted. Your products must be end-user 
products, eg. not components used by other products. Please note that these licences only 
cover your own software, not the publishing of other's software.
