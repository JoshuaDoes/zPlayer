--- TODO ---
	- Modulate all the things and give each module an STDIN/STDOUT pipeline for
	  communication amongst each other
		* Possible latency on very slow systems
		+ Add support for YouTube-DL as a system module to replace the unstable
		  YouTubeInMP3 API service
			* This will widen the range of supported services to more than just YouTube,
			  and zPlayer will attempt to support as many of these as possible
			* This will also re-implement the fossil of the network cache, where the
			  module will keep track of the current downloads and also add a placeholder
			  entry in the playlist for the track with a status flag for "Not ready" until
			  the track is ready
	- Add automatic updating with Stable and Beta channels, optionally supporting
	  a custom update URL for other forks of zPlayer's source code
		* If one were to supply a custom update URL for other forks and the fork
		  has a modified or different update system, this URL could point to a
		  static file that will download and open the latest version of the custom
		  zPlayer fork to auto-install it rather than being required to follow the
		  update logic currently implemented and download the custom zPlayer fork
		  manually
	- Add CD playback
	- Add video playback
	- Add Last.FM support for scrobbling tracks
	- Add user-created themes for complete themeing of the GUI
	- Add playlist exporting
	- Add translation support for all the things
	- Add a settings menu
	- Add repeat and shuffle functionality
	- Add equalizer

--- CHANGELOG ---
Build 19 - JoshuaDoes - April 6th, 2017 - 11:18 PM EST / 23:18 EST
	*** Changed name to zPlayer Preview
		* This was done to match the "perpetual beta" technique I've been using for
		  releasing zPlayer builds
	- Removed everything to do with modules
		* Modules will be implemented (properly) at a later date, but I need to get
		  other things out and working first since this will take up a lot of my time
	+ Fixed an issue where fullscreening the zPlayer window would sometimes have a
	  white border of varying widths all the way around
		* In order for this to be fixed, the drop shadow was sacrificed
	+ Added log file functionality
		* Debug messages will save to and append [.\zPlayer-MON-DAY-YEAR.log]
	+ Changed functionality so that removing the current track would hold the position
	  of where you are in the playlist rather than reset back to the beginning of the
	  playlist
	+ Fixed functionality so that changing the channel volume when no tracks exist would
	  not result in an array out-of-bounds error
	+ Added hotkeys for specific media tasks
	+ Added functionality to allow the user to go to the end of the playlist if they use
	  the Previous button while on the first track of the playlist
	+ Added importing/exporting of playlists and the Import Playlist and Export Playlist
	  buttons
		* Currently only importing of M3U, M3U8, and XSPF playlists are supported
		* Currently only exporting of M3U and M3U8 playlists are supported
	+ Extended the minimum width of the main GUI to accomodate for new buttons
	+ Added the ability to launch zPlayer with files, network URLs, and playlists as
	  multiple command-line arguments
		* This can allow you to choose to open an audio track via zPlayer, opening up the
		  availability of using zPlayer as a daily music player
		* The zPlayer window will not appear until a playlist, file, or network stream is
		  completely loaded
	+ Changed the logo displayed from the JPG to the ICO, deleting the JPG as ICO has
	  transparency
		* This makes me happy because better quality
	+ Added an "About" window that appears when you click on the zPlayer logo
		* Currently this launches zPlayer in an external process with no goal other than
		  to display the About window and then exit
		* A better method will be implemented once child GUIs are a thing again
	+ Fixed an issue where pressing Next while the last track in the playlist was playing
	  would not play the track at the beginning of the playlist
	+ Switched from using ugly and full-color JPGs to transparent ICOs
		* Not only is it also native to AutoIt, but this brings back the quality icons
		  used for making zPlayer look amazing
	+ Added a Maxmize/Restore button
		* When you click it to maximize the window, the icon changes to the restore icon
		  and vice versa
		* Using Aero-snap to maximize or restore the window will also change the icon,
		  however due to AutoIt's limitations the icon won't redraw until you release the
		  window
	+ Finally removed the network cache check timer from ages ago
		* Why did I never catch this?
	+ Added logic to use the user's clipboard contents as the default text entry for the
	  Add URL input box if it contains "http://", "https://", or "ftp://"
		* The text is selected by default, so if you need to manually type something or
		  if you paste in what's in your clipboard then regardless both sides of the party
		  will get the job done
	+ Added logic for hiberation, thus enabling the Hibernate button once again
	+ Added logic to delete the file [hiberfil.m3u] if zPlayer has startup parameters to
	  load certain files and/or playlists
	+ Added logic to automatically play the current song if loading from hibernation mode
	  or command-line parameters were entered
	+ Moved the Add CD and Playlist Management buttons down one row and aligned them to
	  the left
	+ Moved the Import Playlist and Export Playlist buttons to the original locations of
	  the Add CD and Playlist Management buttons respectively
	+ Removed the BassCD library until CD playback is progressed on

Build 18 - JoshuaDoes - March 4th, 2017 - 02:28 AM EST / 02:28 EST
	+ Added resizing of the main interface
	+ Switched from using transparent PNGs to full-color JPGs
		* Sadly JPGs don't have the best quality in the world due to the lack of an
		  alpha channel, so the new icons are going to look a little sharper than
		  the old ones
		* The logo is going to be replaced soon anyways so sorry that it looks terribad
	+ Added logic to display the "File" icon in the service area if a local file is
	  either queued or playing
	+ Fixed many issues regarding interface usage
	+ Added logic to prevent adding network URLs to the playlist if no internet connection
	  is detected
	+ Added a new status for tracks, "Changing position...", for when the user is sliding
	  the audio position slider and a track is loaded
	+ Fixed an issue (that was highly annoying to fix, mind you) where the audio position
	  slider would not update while the track was playing unless the user clicked on a
	  different control in the interface
	+ Fixed an issue where the displayed data would either update more than necessary or
	  when it's not supposed to
	+ Proudly removed the PNG Buttons library
	+ Fixed an issue in the changelog in regards to how the build date and time was
	  separated in the changelog for Build 17

Build 17 - JoshuaDoes - March 2nd, 2017 - 03:33 AM EST / 03:33 EST
	+ Added the ability to click on the service icon to open the current track's
	  remote location
	+ Fixed an issue where clicking on the delete button while the current track is
	  playing would result in the track being removed from the playlist yet continue
	  to play and be unable to be stopped
	+ Fixed an issue where pressing the Previous or Next buttons while there was no
	  track in the playlist would result in a crash due to an out-of-bounds error
	+ Added a status system for the state of the current track, also allowing for
	  slightly more detail to notices
	+ Fixed an issue where the service icon of the current network track would not
	  always update properly
	+ Added a very early work-in-progress module system
		* This will load anything in the "modules" folder and kill it at shutdown
		  at this point in time, but the plan is to have "system modules" that are
		  absolutely necessary for zPlayer to have its official functions which can
		  be swapped out by users for alternatives and also have "custom modules"
		  which can guide zPlayer to do whatever the module wishies
		* Later on a permissions system will be implemented to govern over all modules
	+ Added a very early work-in-progress playlist import and export system
		* This is not yet available for the user to use at all and is not ready, however
		  it will be used for the hibernation playlist and also some playlists from other
		  media players
	+ Added preparations for a YouTube-DL module via the new status flag for the state of
	  the current track, the flag being the number 3 meaning "Not ready"
	+ Fixed an issue where the file version number of the compiled version of zPlayer was
	  "1.0.0.0" rather than "16.0.0.0", however this number has incremented to "17.0.0.0"
	  in this build and will not be made apparent in zPlayer Build 16 by anything except
	  the title

Build 16 - JoshuaDoes - February 24th, 2017 - 01:53 AM EST / 01:53 EST
	-+* Began rewriting from scratch
	*** Changed name to zPlayer Rewrite
	+ Added as much functionality as possible from Build 15
	* Known features not included
		- CD Management
		- Playlist Management (except for the delete button for the current track)
		- Hibernation
	+ Many, many, many performance enhancements
	+ Much cleaner code and overall much easier to manage

Build 15 - JoshuaDoes - February 23rd, 2017 - 02:16 PM EST / 14:16 EST
	+ Fixed the changelog to show the compile date of Build 14
	+ Fixed an issue where adding multiple network tracks to the playlist and then
	  hibernating would result in an array out-of-bounds error with the network
	  cache at the next startup and also only the very first network track appearing
	  in the playlist after rebooting zPlayer
	+ Added the current millisecond to debug logs
	+ Added a shortcut to view the current logs by pressing [CTRL + L] while the
	  main zPlayer window is in focus
		* If you have previously clicked on a button or the playlist view in the
		  main window, please click on one of the empty black areas in order for
		  the shortcut to register
	+ Fixed an issue where adding to or removing from the playlist would not
	  update the playlist, and the user was required to click on the Add CD button
	  to trigger an update
	+ Fixed an issue where some usage scenarios would result in the audio position
	  slider's control becoming fully white
	+ Fixed an issue where some debug logs were logging as the incorrect function
	- Removed old debug logging that was used in test case scenarios
	+ Fixed an issue where adding new local files to the playlist would result in
	  the track position area showing " KB/s" instead of "Ready"
	+ Fixed an issue where displaying or refreshing child GUIs would seem rather
	  laggy on most systems
	+ Added some more verbosity to debug logs and notices
	+ Fixed an issue where moving the audio position slider longer than one second
	  would result in the audio position slider being reset back to the position
	  of the current audio track position, fixing many issues involving the audio
	  position slider
	+ Fixed an issue where the current track position, the current audio position,
	  and the current audio length would flash either rapidly or once every second

Build 14 - JoshuaDoes - February 20th, 2017 - 03:57 PM EST / 15:57 EST
	+ Fixed an issue where MP4 files were listed in the file selection dialog
		* This was a test for BASS functionality and it was forgotten about
		  soon after testing
	+ Fixed an issue where playlist management had the track's title under "Track"
	  instead of "Title"
	+ Fixed an issue where changing the position of the audio track manually and
	  then playing a new track would lock the state of the audio position slider
	+ Fixed an issue where clicking on either the Add CD or the Playlist Management
	  buttons if their child GUI was currently in view would unload it and then
	  load it again, resulting in delays in other ongoing tasks
	+ Added a basic implementation of CD drive listing
		* If no CD-ROM drives exist, an error will be displayed as a notice and
		  the Playlist Management interface will be returned to view
	+ Added a download speed calculator in kilobytes that is always calculated
	  internally but is only shown if the currently selected track is being
	  cached from the network
		* Later on, custom choices on what to display this in may be available
	+ Fixed an issue where pressing the Previous or Next button while audio is not
	  playing would result in the previous (if audio track position was 3 seconds
	  or less), current (if audio track position was more than 3 seconds), or next
	  track being played

Build 13 - JoshuaDoes - February 18th, 2017 - 07:56 AM EST / 07:56 EST
	+ Added logic for child GUIs
	+ Added a child GUI for playlist management, activated by clicking the
	  Playlist Management button
		* This is very experimental and may prove to be ultimately buggy
	+ Added better handling of ID3 tags
	+ Added a Delete Selected Playlist Entry button, which will delete either the
	  current track number from the playlist or, if one is selected, the currently
	  selected track from the playlist
		* This is not properly implemented and may prove to be buggy
	+ Fixed an issue where adding multiple files failed to succeed

Build 12 - JoshuaDoes - February 18th, 2017 - 02:31 AM EST / 02:31 EST
	+ Fixed an issue where the event for the previous function was set to the GUI
	  containing the Previous icon rather than the Previous icon itself
	+ Fixed an issue where the current track number would not be updated if there
	  was an issue with trying to play the currently selected track
	+ Fixed an issue where the currently displayed data would not be removed if
	  the audio was stopped by a reason other than the Stop button
	+ Fixed an issue where holding the hardware keyboard Volume Down or Volume Up
	  would only update the volume once every second when the displayed audio data
	  was refreshed
	+ Fixed an issue where adding a track while the displayed audio data is not
	  being refreshed would not update the playlist track count
	+ Fixed an issue where pressing the Next button when at the end of the playlist
	  would not update the track position
	+ Fixed a major logic bug where importing a playlist results in a failed import
	  of simply the last audio track and also results in a failed attempt at caching
	  the network audio track
		* Network caching of audio tracks after opening a playlist will begin
		  immediately up on their addition to the playlist
		* This issue was currently only able to be produced by opening zPlayer from
		  a hibernation state, as multiple custom playlists can not yet be managed

Build 11 - JoshuaDoes - February 18th, 2017 - 12:13 AM EST / 00:13 EST
	+ Fixed an issue where the audio track position and the volume could not be
	  changed while the audio track is paused
	+ Changed where certain interface elements are located
	+ Changed logic so that all GUI events are handled on a per-event basis
	  rather than running a check every millisecond
	+ Changed logic so that the audio track position and the volume is checked
	  via a timer rather than every millisecond
	+ Fixed an annoying issue where one of the two sliders would be selected
	  when zPlayer opens and stay selected after using it
	+ Added support for streaming YouTube videos in an MP3 audio format by
	  utilizing the "YouTubeInMP3" API located at
	  [https://www.youtubeinmp3.com/api/]
	+ Added logic so that any new additions to services (including the new
	  YouTube streaming support) will display their icons under the titlebar
	  when an audio stream is played from their site
	+ Fixed a logic bug where the volume change was being used to detect
	  errors in the creation of an audio stream rather than using the audio
	  stream creation itself
	+ Fixed logic to specifically require "http://", "https://", or "ftp://"
	+ Added the current date and time to debug logs (only available by
	  running the program from source)
	+ Added a proper implementation of network caching for network audio
	  tracks
		* Pressing the Play button while on a track number that is not yet
		  finished being cached will not play the track and will display
		  the current percentage as a notice
		* Once a network track is fully cached, the user will be notified
		  in a notice
		* This quite literally took hours to do properly and bug-free, and
		  I just figured I should point out that I am very proud of myself
		  for this
	+ Added re-caching of network audio tracks for when a playlist is
	  imported, especially after opening zPlayer from hibernation
	+ Added the current track number out of how many tracks are available
	  in the current playlist with the total percentage of how available
	  the current track is
		* The total percentage is updated live if the currently selected
		  track is being cached in the background

Build 10 - JoshuaDoes - February 16th, 2017 - 12:06 AM EST / 00:06 EST
	+ Added new icons to replace some of the old ones, giving more space to click
	  on the icons
		* All icons were replaced with full-white icons as to be custom-colored
		  programatically
	+ Added method to resize the displayed icons programatically from 64x64 to
	  32x32 to reduce window click-and-drag lag and provide space for more content
		* Any size may be specified in the source code, this being for a planned
		  feature involving icon scaling
	+ Added a volume slider to control the volume of the track
		* The volume is updated live as the slider moves
	+ Added a position slider to control the audio position of the track
		* The audio position of the track is updated live as the sldier moves
	+ Added the new "Z" logo
		* Credits to Ryan Rock for the design

Build 9 - JoshuaDoes - February 13th, 2017 - 07:28 PM EST / 19:28 EST
	+ Fixed file description to be "zPlayer" and moved current file description
	  to file comment, thus resulting in the window in the task bar and the
	  process in task manager no longer being the long description of the
	  program
	+ Fixed an issue where changing from light mode to dark mode would not set
	  the Waxing Crescent icon of the Color Mode button to be the Waxing
	  Gibbous and vice versa
	+ Fixed an issue where pressing the stop button on the native keyboard would
	  result in zPlayer crashing
	+ Fixed an issue where an audio track ending while zPlayer is not in focus
	  would result in random modifier keys being virtually stuck and the next
	  audio track would not play unless zPlayer was focused again
	+ Fixed an issue where changing the audio track would result in the volume
	  resetting to 100
	+ Added precaching for network audio tracks (refer to known bug about issue
	  with playing network audio tracks that are still being precached)
	+ Changed functionality so that the Playlist Management button will
	  temporarily display an AutoIt-based listing of the current playlist even
	  if the internal DevMode flag is disabled

Build 8 - JoshuaDoes - February 12th, 2017 - 02:10 PM EST / 14:10 EST
	+ Updated logic to support multiple file selections in one go

Build 7 - JoshuaDoes - February 12th, 2017 - 01:17 PM EST / 13:17 EST
	+ Added a dark theme along with a theme changer
	+ Added internal playlist importing and exporting
	+ Changed functionality so that the hibernate button will export the current
	  playlist to ``hiberfil.zplay`` and the current track number to
	  ``hiberfil.dat`` and close zPlayer, then load the playlist and track
	  number upon next launch of zPlayer
	+ Fixed an issue where media controls via native keyboard buttons would
	  control zPlayer only, even if the user had another app in focus or wanted
	  to change their system volume
	+ Changed functionality so that the current theme mode is always saved to
	  ``options.dat`` upon start and exit, and is loaded upon start if it exists
	+ Fixed an issue where some notices were not defined
	+ Changed functionality so that DevMode is dynamically enabled or disabled
	  depending on whether or not zPlayer is ran from source or binary, as to
	  help with performance for users who will not need to see the console logs
	+ Added support for MP1, MP2, WAV, and AIFF audio codecs
	+ Changed functionality so that the array for the playlist will only be
	  shown if the DevMode flag is enabled

Build 6 - JoshuaDoes - February 12th, 2017 - 05:35 AM EST / 05:35 EST
	+ Added the displaying of the volume of the current track on the same line as
	  the audio position
	+ Added media and volume controls via native keyboard buttons
	+ Added a work-in-progress playlist system
	+ Changed functionality so that the next button will go to the next song in
	  the playlist
	+ Changed functionality so that the previous button will return to the
	  beginning of the song if the position is 3 seconds or more, else go to the
	  previous song in the playlist
	+ Changed functionality so that the next button will go to the next song in
	  the playlist, and if there is no next song then return to the beginning of
	  the playlist and halt playback
	+ Added a shutdown button that shuts down zPlayer properly
	+ Added a hibernate button that currently does nothing, but is planned to
	  save the playlist to a file and exit and then resume the playlist upon
	  next app launch
	+ Added a minimize button that minimizes the window
	+ Added a color mode button to toggle a light theme and a dark theme

Build 5 - JoshuaDoes - February 12th, 2017 - 12:36 AM EST / 00:36 EST
	+ Fixed an issue where some notices were incorrectly defined
	+ Added the displaying of ID3 tags on the main GUI
	+ Fixed an issue where stopping an audio track would result in the audio location
	  being blank preventing users from playing the track from the beginning
	+ Fixed positioning of ID3 tags, audio position, and notices to look nicer
	+ Fixed an issue where the audio position thread's timer would stop updating the
	  displayed audio position after the notice thread's timer unregistered itself

Build 4 - JoshuaDoes - February 11th, 2017 - 11:38 PM EST / 23:38 EST
	+ Fixed the network URL input box to also display "https://"
	+ Fixed the network URL input box to divide URIs by "|" instead of ","
	+ Fixed an issue where some notices were undefined
	+ Fixed an issue where attempting to add a new track while one is currently
	  playing and then cancelling the track addition will result in the audio
	  location becoming blank and the current audio stream pausing
	+ Fixed an issue where attempting to add the current track will simply
	  pause/resume it; now, it unloads the current track and loads the new one
	  even if it is the same track

Build 3 - JoshuaDoes - Saturday, February 11th, 2017 - 10:57 PM EST / 22:57 EST
	+ Added network URL playback
	+ Fixed an issue where some notices were undefined

Build 2 - JoshuaDoes - Saturday, February 11th, 2017 - 09:55 PM EST / 21:55 EST
	+ Fixed an issue where stopping the current audio stream and then opening a new
	  track would trigger the position update thread but would not actually play the
	  new audio stream

Build 1 - JoshuaDoes - Saturday, February 11th, 2017 - 09:19 PM EST / 21:19 EST
	+ Initial program
