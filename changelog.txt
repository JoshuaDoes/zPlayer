--- TODO ---
	- Modulate all the things and give each module an STDIN/STDOUT pipeline for
		communication amongst each other
		* Possible latency on very slow systems
		+ Add support for YouTube-DL as a system module to replace the unstable
			YouTubeInMP3 API service
			* This will widen the range of supported services to more than just YouTube,
				and zPlayer will attempt to support as many of these as possible
			* This will also re-implement the fossil of the network cache, where the
				module will keep track of the current downloads and also add a placeholder
				entry in the playlist for the track with a status flag for "Not ready" until
				the track is ready
	- Add automatic updating with Stable and Beta channels, optionally supporting
		a custom update URL for other forks of zPlayer's source code
		* If one were to supply a custom update URL for other forks and the fork
			has a modified or different update system, this URL could point to a
			static file that will download and open the latest version of the custom
			zPlayer fork to auto-install it rather than being required to follow the
			update logic currently implemented and download the custom zPlayer fork
			manually
	- Add CD playback
	- Add video playback
	- Add Last.FM support for scrobbling tracks
	- Add translation support for all the things
	- Add a settings menu
	- Add equalizer
	- Add download progress info in the playlist view when downloading/buffering a
		network stream
	- Implement YouTube-DL to replace current network handling
	- Add file tag/info viewer/editor
	- Add informative text that appears in the notification text area to explain what
		something is when you hover over it with your mouse

--- KNOWN BUGS ---
	- You must triple-click an entry in the playlist view to play it, or delay the second click when doing a double click with accurate timing
	- The current API being used for YouTube MP3 playback sometimes returns the
		HTML page for conversion rather than the MP3 file itself if they don't have the
		MP3 in their database
	- Sometimes when adding tracks, the GUI will not update until the window is moved or
		maximized/restored
	* Please report any and all bugs found to me

--- CHANGELOG ---
Build 24 - JoshuaDoes - September 20th, 2017 - 11:33 AM ST / 11:33 EST
	+ Added the ability to search for YouTube videos by pressing the button combination [CTRL + F]
	+ Added the ability to import a YouTube playlist by holding [CTRL] while pressing the Import Playlist button or adding it via the Add URL button
	+ Copied the logic for displaying available ID3 tags to network URLs and edited the BassTags functions to accomodate
	+ Other things that I don't recall doing, as I have not kept up with the changelog
		- Sorry, been a couple months
		- I'm also working on (another) rewrite that's more stable, has more checks, and is overall nicer to use and faster c:
		- Betas for the rewrite will start soon
		- This preview channel is permanently on a feature freeze
		- This changelog is now irrelevant for any future releases (except in the case of bugfixes before the betas start)

Build 23 - JoshuaDoes - July 24th, 2017 - 11:52 AM EST / 11:52 EST
	+ Added the "Nolan" theme
	+ Added functionality to dynamically scan themes directory for all new themes
		* All folders under the theme directory must contain a "themes.properties" file detailing
			information about the theme and the names of each icon
	+ Modified the "Change Theme" button to switch to the new Theme Management interface,
		which shows the current list of themes and allows you to apply a theme to the interface
	+ Added the "View" button to switch to the new View interface, which will show the album art
		of the current audio file (if any), or, once implemented, the currently playing video
	+ Added the "Settings" button to switch to the new (currently empty) Settings interface, which
		will contain a list of settings that can be edited with ease after implementation
	+ Added the "Notifications" button to switch to the new Notifications interface, which contains
		a list of all notifications (originally known as notices) for the current session
	+ Changed functionality so that when a new notice is received, it is instead shown in the
		viewable custom titlebar rather than under the current child interface
	+ Re-organized some of the interface
	+ Improved performance on notifications and overall startup speed
	+ Fixed an issue where adding a new entry to the playlist while Playlist Management was not
		open would result in the current child interface refreshing
	+ Fixed an issue where the volume counter would not update in real time while changing the
		volume
	+ Fixed a major issue spanning many builds where resizing the window and then changing to
		a different child interface would result in an invalidly sized and invalidly docked control
		* The mitigation for this issue was only successful if the window was maximized and its
			original state had an untouched size, but now with the issue being fixed this mitigation
			has been (proudly) removed
	+ Fixed a flaw in logic where removing the first entry from the playlist while other entries are
		still present would result in the current track variable equalling negative one, which is out
		of bounds of what the rest of zPlayer expects and immediately results in a crash when a
		function utilizing the playlist is executed
	+ Changed logic in selecting a playlist entry from sorting through the actual playlist array for
		the playlist entry's visual ID to directly reading the position of the playlist array from the
		playlist entry itself, improving the amount of time it takes to play a song from the playlist
		view in a large playlist
	+ Added the saving (on exit) and loading of settings from the registry at the address
		"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JoshuaDoes\zPlayer"
	+ Added YouTube video thumbnail loading logic for the View interface, which will load the
		highest quality thumbnail possible
	+ Changed functionality so that the zPlayer window defaults to the center of the screen rather
		than an X and Y position of 20
	- Removed automatic playback if loading a hibernation playlist
	+ Added a check to escape the add URL function if no URL was entered rather than allow the
		internal add URL function to fail adding a blank URL
	+ Fixed an issue where ID3 tags containing a pipe character would result in failed attempts to
		display playlist entries in the playlist view
		* For a more technical explanation, AutoIt by default separates data for list views with the
			pipe character; the simple mitigation for this was to instead use a character that normally
			should not appear in an ID3 tag, in this case ASCII char 01 ("SOH")
	+ Added SoundCloud support
		* You must provide your own client ID at this time
	+ Added logic to clean up the ID3 tags displayed above the audio position slider when the current
		entry in the playlist is being played
	+ Fixed a major issue in debugging where undefined notifications were displayed as nothing rather than
		the UID used in attempt to translate to the description of the notification
		* This occurs due to a logical mistype in which I converted the original variables to new names and
			accidentally declared $sNotification (which should contain the description of the notification,
			in this case it's intended to be an invalid UID message) instead of $sNotificationUID (the unique
			identifier that is translated to a more detailed message) in the Else case
	+ Changed the undefined notification UID text to reflect on extra data parameters passed to the UID, if
		any, to help with debugging purposes.

Build 22 - JoshuaDoes - June 12th, 2017 - 10:32 AM EST / 10:32 EST
	+ Changing the "Changing position..." text to "Seeking..." in the bottom right when
		seeking through the current track
	+ Fixed an issue where seeking while the track was paused or stopped would result in
		the track playing after seeking to the desired position
	+ Fixed an issue where stopping the track would prevent the ability to seek to the desired
		position
	+ Fixed an issue where the audio position slider could be dragged away from the 0 position
		before any tracks were ever added to the playlist
	+ Added preparations for custom theme support
	+ Fixed a startup speed impactor by removing a theme re-apply during startup
	+ Re-added the light theme
	+ Fixed an issue where the GUI would slowly repaint every individual control in front of the
		user instead of repainting everything silently and then instantly switching to the finished
		product (to look sleek and fast of course, because realism doesn't appeal to people)

Build 21 - JoshuaDoes - June 10th, 2017 - 09:21 PM EST / 21:21 PM
	+ Fixed an issue where adding new tracks to the playlist while the playlist view was
		active and the window was maxmized would result in zPlayer restoring and then
		maximizing again
	+ Fixed an issue where deleting entries from the playlist would not be reflected in
		the playlist view
	+ Changed frequency from 44100 Hz to 48000 Hz for better audio quality
	+ Fixed an issue where adding one or more entries to the playlist and then deleting
		them all, then attempting to delete or play a non-existant entry, would result in an
		array out-of-bounds error caused by invalid handling of playlist entry deletion
	+ Added multiple out-of-bounds checks to ensure functions requiring entries in the
		playlist would not be ran without there first being an entry in the playlist
	+ Replaced "Unknown" with "?" in all audio tag reads as the default if none exist
	+ Added checks to ensure the GUI wasn't being redrawn when it didn't need to be,
		preventing most unusual flickering on slower systems
	+ Fixed an issue where displaying the proper audio position was being handled
		incorrectly

Build 20 - JoshuaDoes - June 9th, 2017 - 11:17 PM EST / 23:17 EST
	*** I've officially forgotten all about this changelog so I'm just going to
		cross-reference with the previous build for these changes, please
		correct me on any mistakes with a pull request to the GitHub at
		(JoshuaDoes/zPlayer)
	+ Added "random" track selection, disabled by default
		* Currently this is only incorporated to the "next" function, which is used after the
			current track ends and also when pressing the "Next" button
	+ Added playlist repeating to go back to the beginning of the playlist and continue
		playing from there, enabled by default
	+ Added a proper playlist view, with a strange bug requiring triple-clicking to play
		the selection rather than double-clicking
	- Removed a few file types from file selection until proper libraries are implemented
		to handle them (such as FLAC)
	+ Added "fake black" (0x1C1C1C) and "fake white" (0xFAFAFA) as replacements for
		the original black (0x000000) and white (0xFFFFFF) colors in use for the interface
	+ Fixed an issue where some notices were undefined
	+ Added proper CD drive listing, currently with no purpose
	+ Changed functionality to properly handle HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and YouTube URLs when
		parsing any URL added to the "Add URL" dialog box
	+ Prepare for file injection into a currently running zPlayer instance, not yet implemented
		* If you have two separate zPlayer files (renamed or separate folders), they will be
			able to run alongside each other; opening a file using zPlayer will only apply to
			whichever instance's file location matches that of the registry
	+ Fixed an issue where changing the track position would fail
		* It failed very miserably, so I'm actually quite happy that I fixed it
	- Removed the "About" window due to the clunky way it was displayed
	+ Added the ability to silently toggle developer mode
		* To toggle, hold SHIFT and then press G, O, and D at the same time
	+ Added a save button, which, when playing a network track, will silently download
		the track to the chosen location without checking progress
		* In the next update, plans are to have a download progress bar (or buffer bar)
			and also add more things to do with the download either during or after
	+ Added self-extraction of required files so that an entire release can be packed into a
		single executable

Build 19 - JoshuaDoes - April 6th, 2017 - 11:18 PM EST / 23:18 EST
	*** Changed name to zPlayer Preview
		* This was done to match the "perpetual beta" technique I've been using for
			releasing zPlayer builds
	- Removed everything to do with modules
		* Modules will be implemented (properly) at a later date, but I need to get
			other things out and working first since this will take up a lot of my time
	+ Fixed an issue where fullscreening the zPlayer window would sometimes have a
		white border of varying widths all the way around
		* In order for this to be fixed, the drop shadow was sacrificed
	+ Added log file functionality
		* Debug messages will save to and append [.\zPlayer-MON-DAY-YEAR.log]
	+ Changed functionality so that removing the current track would hold the position
		of where you are in the playlist rather than reset back to the beginning of the
		playlist
	+ Fixed functionality so that changing the channel volume when no tracks exist would
		not result in an array out-of-bounds error
	+ Added hotkeys for specific media tasks
	+ Added functionality to allow the user to go to the end of the playlist if they use
		the Previous button while on the first track of the playlist
	+ Added importing/exporting of playlists and the Import Playlist and Export Playlist
		buttons
		* Currently only importing of M3U, M3U8, and XSPF playlists are supported
		* Currently only exporting of M3U and M3U8 playlists are supported
	+ Extended the minimum width of the main GUI to accomodate for new buttons
	+ Added the ability to launch zPlayer with files, network URLs, and playlists as
		multiple command-line arguments
		* This can allow you to choose to open an audio track via zPlayer, opening up the
			availability of using zPlayer as a daily music player
		* The zPlayer window will not appear until a playlist, file, or network stream is
			completely loaded
	+ Changed the logo displayed from the JPG to the ICO, deleting the JPG as ICO has
		transparency
		* This makes me happy because better quality
	+ Added an "About" window that appears when you click on the zPlayer logo
		* Currently this launches zPlayer in an external process with no goal other than
			to display the About window and then exit
		* A better method will be implemented once child GUIs are a thing again
	+ Fixed an issue where pressing Next while the last track in the playlist was playing
		would not play the track at the beginning of the playlist
	+ Switched from using ugly and full-color JPGs to transparent ICOs
		* Not only is it also native to AutoIt, but this brings back the quality icons
			used for making zPlayer look amazing
	+ Added a Maxmize/Restore button
		* When you click it to maximize the window, the icon changes to the restore icon
			and vice versa
		* Using Aero-snap to maximize or restore the window will also change the icon,
			however due to AutoIt's limitations the icon won't redraw until you release the
			window
	+ Finally removed the network cache check timer from ages ago
		* Why did I never catch this?
	+ Added logic to use the user's clipboard contents as the default text entry for the
		Add URL input box if it contains "http://", "https://", or "ftp://"
		* The text is selected by default, so if you need to manually type something or
			if you paste in what's in your clipboard then regardless both sides of the party
			will get the job done
	+ Added logic for hiberation, thus enabling the Hibernate button once again
	+ Added logic to delete the file [hiberfil.m3u] if zPlayer has startup parameters to
		load certain files and/or playlists
	+ Added logic to automatically play the current song if loading from hibernation mode
		or command-line parameters were entered
	+ Moved the Add CD and Playlist Management buttons down one row and aligned them to
		the left
	+ Moved the Import Playlist and Export Playlist buttons to the original locations of
		the Add CD and Playlist Management buttons respectively
	+ Removed the BassCD library until CD playback is progressed on

Build 18 - JoshuaDoes - March 4th, 2017 - 02:28 AM EST / 02:28 EST
	+ Added resizing of the main interface
	+ Switched from using transparent PNGs to full-color JPGs
		* Sadly JPGs don't have the best quality in the world due to the lack of an
			alpha channel, so the new icons are going to look a little sharper than
			the old ones
		* The logo is going to be replaced soon anyways so sorry that it looks terribad
	+ Added logic to display the "File" icon in the service area if a local file is
		either queued or playing
	+ Fixed many issues regarding interface usage
	+ Added logic to prevent adding network URLs to the playlist if no internet connection
		is detected
	+ Added a new status for tracks, "Changing position...", for when the user is sliding
		the audio position slider and a track is loaded
	+ Fixed an issue (that was highly annoying to fix, mind you) where the audio position
		slider would not update while the track was playing unless the user clicked on a
		different control in the interface
	+ Fixed an issue where the displayed data would either update more than necessary or
		when it's not supposed to
	+ Proudly removed the PNG Buttons library
	+ Fixed an issue in the changelog in regards to how the build date and time was
		separated in the changelog for Build 17

Build 17 - JoshuaDoes - March 2nd, 2017 - 03:33 AM EST / 03:33 EST
	+ Added the ability to click on the service icon to open the current track's
		remote location
	+ Fixed an issue where clicking on the delete button while the current track is
		playing would result in the track being removed from the playlist yet continue
		to play and be unable to be stopped
	+ Fixed an issue where pressing the Previous or Next buttons while there was no
		track in the playlist would result in a crash due to an out-of-bounds error
	+ Added a status system for the state of the current track, also allowing for
		slightly more detail to notices
	+ Fixed an issue where the service icon of the current network track would not
		always update properly
	+ Added a very early work-in-progress module system
		* This will load anything in the "modules" folder and kill it at shutdown
			at this point in time, but the plan is to have "system modules" that are
			absolutely necessary for zPlayer to have its official functions which can
			be swapped out by users for alternatives and also have "custom modules"
			which can guide zPlayer to do whatever the module wishies
		* Later on a permissions system will be implemented to govern over all modules
	+ Added a very early work-in-progress playlist import and export system
		* This is not yet available for the user to use at all and is not ready, however
			it will be used for the hibernation playlist and also some playlists from other
			media players
	+ Added preparations for a YouTube-DL module via the new status flag for the state of
		the current track, the flag being the number 3 meaning "Not ready"
	+ Fixed an issue where the file version number of the compiled version of zPlayer was
		"1.0.0.0" rather than "16.0.0.0", however this number has incremented to "17.0.0.0"
		in this build and will not be made apparent in zPlayer Build 16 by anything except
		the title

Build 16 - JoshuaDoes - February 24th, 2017 - 01:53 AM EST / 01:53 EST
	-+* Began rewriting from scratch
	*** Changed name to zPlayer Rewrite
	+ Added as much functionality as possible from Build 15
	* Known features not included
		- CD Management
		- Playlist Management (except for the delete button for the current track)
		- Hibernation
	+ Many, many, many performance enhancements
	+ Much cleaner code and overall much easier to manage

Build 15 - JoshuaDoes - February 23rd, 2017 - 02:16 PM EST / 14:16 EST
	+ Fixed the changelog to show the compile date of Build 14
	+ Fixed an issue where adding multiple network tracks to the playlist and then
		hibernating would result in an array out-of-bounds error with the network
		cache at the next startup and also only the very first network track appearing
		in the playlist after rebooting zPlayer
	+ Added the current millisecond to debug logs
	+ Added a shortcut to view the current logs by pressing [CTRL + L] while the
		main zPlayer window is in focus
		* If you have previously clicked on a button or the playlist view in the
			main window, please click on one of the empty black areas in order for
			the shortcut to register
	+ Fixed an issue where adding to or removing from the playlist would not
		update the playlist, and the user was required to click on the Add CD button
		to trigger an update
	+ Fixed an issue where some usage scenarios would result in the audio position
		slider's control becoming fully white
	+ Fixed an issue where some debug logs were logging as the incorrect function
	- Removed old debug logging that was used in test case scenarios
	+ Fixed an issue where adding new local files to the playlist would result in
		the track position area showing " KB/s" instead of "Ready"
	+ Fixed an issue where displaying or refreshing child GUIs would seem rather
		laggy on most systems
	+ Added some more verbosity to debug logs and notices
	+ Fixed an issue where moving the audio position slider longer than one second
		would result in the audio position slider being reset back to the position
		of the current audio track position, fixing many issues involving the audio
		position slider
	+ Fixed an issue where the current track position, the current audio position,
		and the current audio length would flash either rapidly or once every second

Build 14 - JoshuaDoes - February 20th, 2017 - 03:57 PM EST / 15:57 EST
	+ Fixed an issue where MP4 files were listed in the file selection dialog
		* This was a test for BASS functionality and it was forgotten about
			soon after testing
	+ Fixed an issue where playlist management had the track's title under "Track"
		instead of "Title"
	+ Fixed an issue where changing the position of the audio track manually and
		then playing a new track would lock the state of the audio position slider
	+ Fixed an issue where clicking on either the Add CD or the Playlist Management
		buttons if their child GUI was currently in view would unload it and then
		load it again, resulting in delays in other ongoing tasks
	+ Added a basic implementation of CD drive listing
		* If no CD-ROM drives exist, an error will be displayed as a notice and
			the Playlist Management interface will be returned to view
	+ Added a download speed calculator in kilobytes that is always calculated
		internally but is only shown if the currently selected track is being
		cached from the network
		* Later on, custom choices on what to display this in may be available
	+ Fixed an issue where pressing the Previous or Next button while audio is not
		playing would result in the previous (if audio track position was 3 seconds
		or less), current (if audio track position was more than 3 seconds), or next
		track being played

Build 13 - JoshuaDoes - February 18th, 2017 - 07:56 AM EST / 07:56 EST
	+ Added logic for child GUIs
	+ Added a child GUI for playlist management, activated by clicking the
		Playlist Management button
		* This is very experimental and may prove to be ultimately buggy
	+ Added better handling of ID3 tags
	+ Added a Delete Selected Playlist Entry button, which will delete either the
		current track number from the playlist or, if one is selected, the currently
		selected track from the playlist
		* This is not properly implemented and may prove to be buggy
	+ Fixed an issue where adding multiple files failed to succeed

Build 12 - JoshuaDoes - February 18th, 2017 - 02:31 AM EST / 02:31 EST
	+ Fixed an issue where the event for the previous function was set to the GUI
		containing the Previous icon rather than the Previous icon itself
	+ Fixed an issue where the current track number would not be updated if there
		was an issue with trying to play the currently selected track
	+ Fixed an issue where the currently displayed data would not be removed if
		the audio was stopped by a reason other than the Stop button
	+ Fixed an issue where holding the hardware keyboard Volume Down or Volume Up
		would only update the volume once every second when the displayed audio data
		was refreshed
	+ Fixed an issue where adding a track while the displayed audio data is not
		being refreshed would not update the playlist track count
	+ Fixed an issue where pressing the Next button when at the end of the playlist
		would not update the track position
	+ Fixed a major logic bug where importing a playlist results in a failed import
		of simply the last audio track and also results in a failed attempt at caching
		the network audio track
		* Network caching of audio tracks after opening a playlist will begin
			immediately up on their addition to the playlist
		* This issue was currently only able to be produced by opening zPlayer from
			a hibernation state, as multiple custom playlists can not yet be managed

Build 11 - JoshuaDoes - February 18th, 2017 - 12:13 AM EST / 00:13 EST
	+ Fixed an issue where the audio track position and the volume could not be
		changed while the audio track is paused
	+ Changed where certain interface elements are located
	+ Changed logic so that all GUI events are handled on a per-event basis
		rather than running a check every millisecond
	+ Changed logic so that the audio track position and the volume is checked
		via a timer rather than every millisecond
	+ Fixed an annoying issue where one of the two sliders would be selected
		when zPlayer opens and stay selected after using it
	+ Added support for streaming YouTube videos in an MP3 audio format by
		utilizing the "YouTubeInMP3" API located at
		[https://www.youtubeinmp3.com/api/]
	+ Added logic so that any new additions to services (including the new
		YouTube streaming support) will display their icons under the titlebar
		when an audio stream is played from their site
	+ Fixed a logic bug where the volume change was being used to detect
		errors in the creation of an audio stream rather than using the audio
		stream creation itself
	+ Fixed logic to specifically require "http://", "https://", or "ftp://"
	+ Added the current date and time to debug logs (only available by
		running the program from source)
	+ Added a proper implementation of network caching for network audio
		tracks
		* Pressing the Play button while on a track number that is not yet
			finished being cached will not play the track and will display
			the current percentage as a notice
		* Once a network track is fully cached, the user will be notified
			in a notice
		* This quite literally took hours to do properly and bug-free, and
			I just figured I should point out that I am very proud of myself
			for this
	+ Added re-caching of network audio tracks for when a playlist is
		imported, especially after opening zPlayer from hibernation
	+ Added the current track number out of how many tracks are available
		in the current playlist with the total percentage of how available
		the current track is
		* The total percentage is updated live if the currently selected
			track is being cached in the background

Build 10 - JoshuaDoes - February 16th, 2017 - 12:06 AM EST / 00:06 EST
	+ Added new icons to replace some of the old ones, giving more space to click
		on the icons
		* All icons were replaced with full-white icons as to be custom-colored
			programatically
	+ Added method to resize the displayed icons programatically from 64x64 to
		32x32 to reduce window click-and-drag lag and provide space for more content
		* Any size may be specified in the source code, this being for a planned
			feature involving icon scaling
	+ Added a volume slider to control the volume of the track
		* The volume is updated live as the slider moves
	+ Added a position slider to control the audio position of the track
		* The audio position of the track is updated live as the sldier moves
	+ Added the new "Z" logo
		* Credits to Ryan Rock for the design

Build 9 - JoshuaDoes - February 13th, 2017 - 07:28 PM EST / 19:28 EST
	+ Fixed file description to be "zPlayer" and moved current file description
		to file comment, thus resulting in the window in the task bar and the
		process in task manager no longer being the long description of the
		program
	+ Fixed an issue where changing from light mode to dark mode would not set
		the Waxing Crescent icon of the Color Mode button to be the Waxing
		Gibbous and vice versa
	+ Fixed an issue where pressing the stop button on the native keyboard would
		result in zPlayer crashing
	+ Fixed an issue where an audio track ending while zPlayer is not in focus
		would result in random modifier keys being virtually stuck and the next
		audio track would not play unless zPlayer was focused again
	+ Fixed an issue where changing the audio track would result in the volume
		resetting to 100
	+ Added precaching for network audio tracks (refer to known bug about issue
		with playing network audio tracks that are still being precached)
	+ Changed functionality so that the Playlist Management button will
		temporarily display an AutoIt-based listing of the current playlist even
		if the internal DevMode flag is disabled

Build 8 - JoshuaDoes - February 12th, 2017 - 02:10 PM EST / 14:10 EST
